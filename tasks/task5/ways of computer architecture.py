    computer architecture refers to the end-to-end structure of a computer system
    that determines how its components interact with each other in helping to execute the machine’s purpose
    there is two types of it CISC(Complex instruction set computer) and RISC(reduced instruction set computer)
'''
'''
    CISC processors have one processing unit, auxiliary memory, and a tiny register set 
    containing hundreds of unique commands.
    These processors execute a task with a single instruction, 
    making a programmer’s work simpler since fewer lines of code are required to complete the operation
    This method utilizes less memory but may need more time to execute instructions
    and work faster for high level languages compilers 
    and this means it is more expensive
'''
'''
    while RISK contains fewer commands code for favor of register sets
    this means more insructions needed for optaining the same program
    but the instructions take less clock cycles 
    and it uses more RAM 
    and this means it's cheaper and easier to design
'''

    in the end there is no one is BTETER than the other 
    they both have cons ad pros and this means 
    it depends of what do you need them for
    arm and idm uses RISK 
    while x86 uses CISC
