First Come, First Served (FCFS) is a type of scheduling algorithm used by operating systems and networks to efficiently and automatically execute queued tasks, 
processes and requests by the order of their arrival First Come, First Served is one of the most efficient and autonomous types of scheduling algorithm because 
it requires little-to-no human or (AI) intervention and does not waste time prioritizing tasks and requests by their urgency or level of complexity.
the party responsible for the scheduling is the CPU itself instead of software or an alternate, more complex job scheduling algorithm.

Priority scheduling is a non-preemptive algorithm and one of the most common scheduling algorithms in batch systems 
Each process is assigned a priority. Process with highest priority is to be executed first and so on 
Processes with same priority are executed on first come first served basis
Priority can be decided based on memory requirements, time requirements or any other resource requirement

Round Robin is the preemptive process scheduling algorithm.
Each process is provided a fix time to execute, it is called a quantum
Once a process is executed for a given time period, it is preempted and other process executes for a given time period
Context switching is used to save states of preempted processes
