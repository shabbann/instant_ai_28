   at the very core of devops is pipeline to test and release
    ci/cd tools is the most important tool in devops
    the most popular one is jenkins
    second is cloud platform to be deployment environment
    third is packaging where it is done by docker
    but docker made deployment much easier so alot of packaging is created and become hard to manage
    that's when kubernetes came to scale and heal microservices
    then monitoring and alerting come to add protection to the project
    and for extra protection we add infrastructures if the servers got down
