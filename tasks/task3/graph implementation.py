'''
    graph implementation can be done with two methods(adjacency list and adjacency matrex
'''
'''
    adjacency list is an array of linked list
    each linkedlist has unique node at the head
    all adjacent neighbors in the graph to that node are added to the linked list

'''
'''
    adjacency matrix is a 2d square array t represent edges between nodes using boolens
    to check an edge u need O(1)
    space complexity is O(n^2)
