(RPA) is a software technology that makes it easy to build, deploy, 
and manage software robots that emulate humans actions interacting with digital systems and software. Just like people,
software robots can do things like understand what’s on a screen, complete the right keystrokes, navigate systems, 
identify and extract data, and perform a wide range of defined actions. 
But software robots can do it faster and more consistently than people, without the need to get up and stretch or take a coffee break.

Today, RPA is driving new efficiencies and freeing people from repetitive tedium
across a broad swath of industries and processes. Enterprises in industries ranging
from financial services to healthcare to manufacturing to the public sector to retail
and far beyond have implemented RPA in areas as diverse as finance, compliance,
legal, customer service, operations, and IT. And that’s just for starters.

RPA has become so widespread because it is broadly applicable. Virtually any high-
volume, business-rules-driven, repeatable process is a great candidate for
automation—and increasingly so are cognitive processes that require higher-order AI skills.
