# What is non-probability sampling methods?
Non-probability sampling is a method of selecting units from a population using a subjective (i.e. non-random) method.
## Convenience or haphazard sampling

Units are selected in an arbitrary manner with little or no planning involved. Haphazard sampling assumes that the population units are all alike, then any unit may be chosen for the sample. An example of haphazard sampling is the vox pop survey where the interviewer selects any person who happens to walk by. Unfortunately, unless the population units are truly similar, selection is subject to the biases of the interviewer and whoever happened to walk by at the time of sampling.
## Volunteer sampling

The respondents are only volunteers in this method. Generally, volunteers must be screened so as to get a set of characteristics suitable for the purposes of the survey (e.g. individuals with a particular disease). This method can be subject to large selection biases, but is sometimes necessary. For example, for ethical reasons, volunteers with particular medical conditions may have to be solicited for some medical experiments.
Another example of volunteer sampling is callers to a radio or television show, when an issue is discussed and listeners are invited to call in to express their opinions. Only the people who care strongly enough about the subject one way or another tend to respond. The silent majority does not typically respond, resulting in a large selection bias. Volunteer sampling is often used to select individuals for focus groups or in-depth interviews (i.e. for qualitative testing, where no attempt is made to generalize to the whole population).
## Judgement sampling

With this method, sampling is done based on previous ideas of population composition and behaviour. An expert with knowledge of the population decides which units in the population should be sampled. In other words, the expert purposely selects what is considered to be a representative sample. Judgment sampling is subject to the researcher’s biases and is perhaps even more biased than haphazard sampling.

Since any preconceptions the researcher has are reflected in the sample, large biases can be introduced if these preconceptions are inaccurate. However, it can be useful in exploratory studies, for example in selecting members for focus groups or in-depth interviews to test specific aspects of a questionnaire.
## Snowball or network sampling

Suppose a researcher wishes to find rare individuals in the population, and already knows of the existence of some of these individuals and how to contact them. One approach is to contact those individuals and simply ask them if they know anyone like themselves, then contact those people, etc. The sample grows like a snowball rolling down a hill to hopefully include virtually everybody with that characteristic. Snowball sampling is useful for rare or hard to reach populations such as people with disabilities, homeless people, drug users, or other persons who may not belong to an organised group or such as musicians, painters, or poets, not readily identified on a survey list frame. However, some individuals or subgroups may have no chance of being sampled. In order to be able to generalize the conclusion to the whole population, some assumptions, which are usually not met, are required.
## Quota sampling

This is one of the most common forms of non-probability sampling. Sampling is done until a specific number of units (quotas) for various subpopulations have been selected. Quota sampling is a means for satisfying sample size objectives for the subpopulations.
The quotas may be based on population proportions. For example, if there are 100 men and 100 women in the population and a sample of 20 are to be drawn, 10 men and 10 women may be interviewed. Quota sampling can be considered preferable to other forms of non-probability sampling (e.g. judgment sampling) because it forces the inclusion of members of different subpopulations.
## Crowdsourcing

Crowdsourcing has been defined slightly differently by researchers from various areas. Despite the multiplicity of definitions for crowdsourcing, one constant has been the broadcasting of a problem to the public, and an open call for contributions to help solve the problem. Members of the public submit solutions that are then owned by the entity (e.g. individuals, companies, or organizations), which originally broadcast the problem. Crowdsourcing is channelling the experts’ desire to solve a problem and then freely sharing the answer with everyone.
As part of Statistics Canada’s modernization, crowdsourcing has become an innovative way to collect valuable information for statistical purposes. By using crowdsourcing as the only collection method, surveys can be executed quickly with reduced cost and response burden. To better understand the challenges associated with crowdsourcing and to ensure that the results are good quality, methods are being developed to compare and validate the data with other sources of complementary data. A couple of examples are outlined below.
## Web panels

A web panel (or online or internet panel) could be defined as an access panel of people willing to respond to web questionnaires. It contains a sample of potential respondents who declare that they will cooperate for future data collection if selected. A web panel survey is a survey utilizing samples from web panels.
